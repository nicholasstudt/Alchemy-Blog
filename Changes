-[ Todo ]--------------------------------------------------------------


 	- A real comment implementation.
		- Inline or not comments option. ( article override )
		- Add open comment period. 0 for forever. ( article override,
		  default in the blog/category )
		- Comments inline on a story or not by article option.
		- editable comments, should note that they have been edited in
		  the public view.
	- Multiple Authors, and the ability to have different users not able
	  to edit each others entries.
		- Authors may be limited to a particular blog.
		- Pick users to admin a blog... 
		- Assign authors to a particular blog.
 	- Better RSS support.
 	- File management for entries.
	- Entry types to allow for multiple entry formats, think photo blog
	  vs regular blog vs just link lists.
		- How do we do blogmarks ? Is it a category option on what to show?
		- How do I do a photo book ?
 	- Simpler interface for posting entries.
 	- Built in support for multiple ping hosts.
	- Multiple archive views: A list, like the current incarnation, and
	  an actual calendar.
 	- Automatic thumbnail generation.
	- Entry validation, and automatic entry encoding, to simplify
	  posting for novices.
	- *Possible* Plug-ins, to allow for stuff, this likely will be a
	  late addition. 
	- Ident length may be set by blog.
	- Add the help documentation.
	- Allow prev/next by article, like a photoblog does.
	
	- Add the ability to manage files and generate links inline.

	- Add the help documentation.
